You probably don\’t even know who someone as glorious as Mr. Smith is! A banking tycoon attending the ball as well!” Drizella sneered, fanning herself with the royal invitation she retrieved. Cinderella froze, jumping up on her feet, her stepsisters laughing at her obedience of not sitting with them. Except that wasn’t the case; Cinderella was shocked to know that the very person she needed in her life right now was also attending the ball!'

  '“Do you think Prince Charming would be roped in with that old-fashioned dress? It is the 21st Century after all…” The Fairy Godmother contemplated, as she hesitantly conjured the dress of Cinderella’s choice. “I am not there for the prince.” Cinderella countered. “But if he really does fall for me, he should like me for what\’s underneath the dress, not my dress. He didn’t organize the ball to marry my dress! It is the 21st Century after all!” The mice nodded in agreement.',
  '“The marvellous dress!” A mice squeaked. “It is beautiful!” Cinderella beamed as Fairy Godmother fashioned the dress out of thin air. Cinderella did a twirl, watching the layers of her dress sway gently with each other. She had never worn such a beautiful dress, ever since she has been imprisoned. '

Or a model from a playboy magazine!” Cinderella looked down at her attire, admiring her dress. Maybe this could help her cinch her business deal better?',
  'Cinderella stared at her choice of dress, affronted. She had merely grabbed a random design and chucked it at her Fairy Godmother because a dress, of all things, was not her priority. The mice chuckled at Cinderella\’s choice of dress, knowing that it was something Cinderella would never be caught dead in. They scurried away when Cinderella glared.',
  'Cinderella admired her body in the dress Fairy Godmother had conjured out of thin air. She, for once in her life, was not focusing on her prospects of investment business but on how good she looked. Heck, why did she suffer as a servant for so long, when she had so much potential to strike out as a model, or maybe even an actress?

Maybe, just maybe, they made a mistake by engaging her services… It took a lot of effort just to paint the summoning circle, too.',
  'Fairy Godmother was looking like she regretted her life decisions. “Why did I have this in my designs?” She muttered, contemplating if she should attempt to change Cinderella\’s mind about wearing a protection suit to the ball. I mean, granted, she was the one who said “pick anything you want to wear!” at first, but she was not counting on the fact that the PPE design suit was among the designs. But Cinderella looked pretty happy with the suit…',
  '“This is great armour!” Cinderella exclaimed. Fairy Godmother looked terrified at Cinderella\’s decision at fashion. “Is she always like that?” She mumbled to the sparrow, worried. The sparrow whacked Cinderella\’s head with her wing. “What are you thinking!” the sparrow screeched. “Why this outfit!” Cinderella huffed. “It\’s COVID-19 during this time!” she protested. “We need protection!” Fairy Godmother rolled her eyes. “Okay…” she didn’t have much of a say, to begin with.

Fairy Godmother rubbed her temples to soothe her great headache. She was definitely not counting on Cinderella to start being violent… Soon, the Grandma in the house was clearly not entertaining this nonsense and kicked the wolf out of the house after listening to Cinderella\’s proposal, sending a few machineguns out at the same time. “Be a man!” She snapped, ignoring the wolf\’s feeble protests that she was a girl, not a man.',
  'Fairy Godmother watched as Cinderella knocked on another door, and a wolf in Lolita clothes appeared. She immediately thrusted a basket of sweet muffins into her hands, and the wolf stared at Cinderella, startled, before kindly inviting her into her house. After just a while, the wolf came out of the house again, this time armed in several rifles and flamethrowers. Fairy Godmother wanted to faint again. ',
  'Cinderella knocked on the door patiently, but no one answered the door. Then, without warning, she threw a high kick and slammed the door open, knocking the feeble lock off. Fairy Godmother choked on her spit. This was NOT how you asked for help! There was a girly screech, and Cinderella cheerfully dragged a wolf in Lolita outfit out of the house. “You are coming with me!” She smiled, grabbing some ammunition from the house, like it was perfectly normal to even have so many guns in a little cottage in a fantastical forest. Notably, she was ignoring the wolf\’s protests.'

Cinderella charged determinedly to the next door, rapping on it loudly. A wolf in Lolita outfit opened the door in confusion, and Cinderella did not even give her a chance to register what was going on before grabbing her in a friendly headlock, despite the huge size different. “Come with me, we have a ball to go to!” She cheered. ',
  '“Maybe this is a bad idea, you don’t really need an army, do you?” Fairy Godmother tried to reason with Cinderella as they walked to their next cottage. “If the concern is to get into the ball, I can wave my wand and we can do something less… chaotic.” Cinderella pouted at Fairy Godmother as she rapped her knuckles on the door they arrived at. “But what would the fun be in that?” She explained, waving away Fairy Godmother\’s very reasonable concerns. “Don\’t worry!” When the door opened to reveal a wolf in Lolita outfit, she simply explained her agenda in a few sentences before the wolf grinned and agreed, coming along with them.',
  '“Cinderella, stop this before I take away your beautiful dress!” Fairy Godmother tried her best to sound threatening, as though it would scare Cinderella into submission. Without expecting it, it was her animal friends who answered for Cinderella. “You can\’t, you can\’t!” They squeaked, waving the paper contract Fairy Godmother had signed when she was materialized in Cinderella’s bedroom. “We have a contract, you can\’t break it and run! What would the other fairies think?” Never did Fairy Godmother in her life, at this age, expect that she would end up sulking and pouting while she watched Cinderella make an alliance with a gentle wolf in a Lolita costume.

A-ha-ha-ha!” Fairy Godmother paled, as she watched Cinderella make a new alliance with, this time, a gentle wolf who looked too big for her little Lolita dress.',
  '“Pay us,” the animals chanted in a chorus. Fairy Godmother was taken aback. What were these animals? Why were they so calculative? They must have gotten this influence from Cinderella, who dealt with investment plans all night for god-knows-how-long. “If I give you some fruits and nuts, would you tell me?” She bargained. The animals shook their head. “No, only cash.” Fairy Godmother rubbed her temples in frustration (she could not conjure cash, it was beyond the law of magic to do so, and not to mention completely unethical) as she watched Cinderella befriend a wolf in a Lolita dress, trudging back to them hand-in-paw.',
  'Fairy Godmother posed the question in mind to the animals. However, the animals looked like they could not afford to give a damn. They were busy cleaning their own fur, chattering among themselves, staring into space, or just taking a nap while Cinderella conducted her business visits. Fairy Godmother sulked, as she took a seat beside those sleeping, watching Cinderella come back with a wolf in a Lolita outfit. “She\’s our new ally!” she beamed, the wolf nodding her head in approval. Fairy Godmother greatly needed Whiskey now.'

Cinderella swung her weapon in a 360 swing, instantly wiping out a whole bunch of jelly-legged soldiers. She trudged on, swinging her arm haphazardly and yelling a bunch of random things. Frankly, she had absolutely no idea what she was doing, but she knew she had to sound and look intimidating to get through a whole platoon of trained royal guards.'

The dwarf was not doing any better. He glared at Cinderella grumpily. “The deal was to let us make chaos! There was no hide and seek in the deal!” Cinderella groaned, letting her two adversaries go. She continued running through the crowd. It seemed that she had to do the job by herself.',

Maybe it was better off finding Mr. Smith on her own.
